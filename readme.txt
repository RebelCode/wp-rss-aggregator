WP RSS Aggregator is the original & most popular WordPress solution for importing RSS feeds, auto-blogging, content curation & aggregation.

== Description ==

WP RSS Aggregator is the original and best plugin for importing, merging and displaying RSS and Atom feeds on your WordPress site. It's the most comprehensive and elegant RSS feed importer for WordPress.

== Automatically import RSS feeds & display them on your site ==

* No limit on the number of sources to import from.
* No limit on the number of items to import.
* Automate each feed's import with individual or global schedules.
* Multiple [templates](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/457-templates) to display items across your site.
* Choose to show, hide and/or link the author, source and publish date for every template.
* Show or hide pagination on your templates, and display specific pages.
* Use our [wp-rss-aggregator] [shortcode](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/54-how-to-use-the-shortcode-to-display-feed-items) or [Gutenberg block](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/454-displaying-imported-items-block-gutenberg) to display items.
* Feed auto-discovery (add sources without the exact RSS feed URL).
* Open YouTube, DailyMotion and Vimeo videos directly.
* Limit the number of feed items stored for better performance.
* Limit the number of feed items fetched per import for better performance.
* Create a custom RSS feed from imported items to use elsewhere.
* Extendable via action and filter hooks.

== NEW SINCE v4.13: Templates, gutenberg block, improved logs ==

Create as many [templates](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/457-templates) as you need to display feed items in different ways across your site. Be it on the homepage, in a sidebar, or in the footer, you can specify which template to use and which sources to display in each individual area.

Our brand new [gutenberg block](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/454-displaying-imported-items-block-gutenberg) ensures seamless integration with WordPress. Choose the template to use and the sources to display, then you're all set (plus a few other customisation options). If you are using the classic WordPress editor, we've got you covered. Click on the WP RSS Aggregator button in the TinyMCE editor to open our shortcode modal. It has all the same options as the block, ensuring that no functionality is lost no matter what you use.

[Debug logs](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/110-error-logs-system-information) are an important part of any site. From time to time, some feeds may have problems that are hard to find. With our new and improved logging system we are reducing the time it takes to find the problem and making it easier to figure out the best solution.

== Who is the plugin for?? ==

Importing and displaying RSS feeds is helpful for many types of sites:

* Curate news, videos and more from the top sources in your niche.
* Add related posts from other sites to your site.
* Curate job, real estate or other listings for your market or niche.
* Embed videos from other sources (Youtube) to engage more visitors.
* Aggregate podcast episodes related to your hobby or profession.
* Writers, display your works from multiple sites in your portfolio.
* And much more...

For example...

* [WP News Desk](http://wpnewsdesk.com/) curates WordPress news, tutorials and more from over 100 trusted sources.
* [Travel Blogger Community](http://travelbloggercommunity.com/) does something similar to share blog posts from well-known travellers.
* [Crypto Headlines](https://cryptoheadlines.com/youtube-videos/) shares Youtube videos from popular Youtubers.
* [Euro Finance Blogs](https://eurofinanceblogs.com/) curates content on investment, personal finance and early retirement.

Browse through our [**Showcase**](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/showcase/) to see how WP RSS Aggregator is being put to great use on a large variety of WordPress sites.

== Attention bloggers, content marketers, site owners ==

Increase your WordPress site's credibility and popularity by importing full or partial posts, videos, and more into your site with our premium add-ons.

* Site Owners & Content Marketers - Curate content to **keep your avid readers on your site for longer**.

== SEO benefits from importing RSS feeds ==

Importing RSS feeds alone won't improve your site's SEO, however, if you curate content (articles, tutorials, videos, listings, etc) and bring in quality traffic, the benefits begin to appear:

* Generate lots of new backlinks to your site.
* Enhance your online presence and gain more trust.
* And therefore, you can help boost your SEO! [Learn more from WP Mayor.](https://wpmayor.com/3-ways-content-curation-impacts-your-sites-seo/)

*Quick note: Please don't steal other people's work; give credit where it's due.*

== Premium add-ons to import full or partial posts ==

Import RSS feeds as WordPress Posts (or any other post type). You can then use your theme, a page builder, or a tool like Toolset to display the content anywhere you want, just the way you want it.

Our **[Advanced Feeds Bundle](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/extension/advanced-feeds-bundle/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_afb_link&utm_content=afb_link)** ([demo](http://demo.wprssaggregator.com/)) consists of 3 powerful add-ons:

* **[Feed to Post](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/extension/feed-to-post/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_f2p_link&utm_content=f2p_link)**
* **[Full Text RSS Feeds](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/extension/full-text-rss-feeds/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_ftr_link&utm_content=ftr_link)**
* **[Keyword Filtering](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/extension/keyword-filtering/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_kf_link&utm_content=kf_link)**

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2z_bNws2MM]

Here's a quick look at what these add-ons can offer:

* Import Posts as Drafts (to edit or approve) or set them to Publish automatically.
* Automatically assign categories and/or tags to imported posts.
* Import all media within the content and automatically set featured images.
* Import the original author's details or assign another user as the author.
* Automatically add you own custom content before or after imported posts.
* Custom field mapping to map the data you want to where you need it.
* Exclude unwanted elements from the original source with extraction rules.
* Import only the items you want with specific keyword, phrase and tag filters.
* Connect to our premium full text service to import the full content from sources that are missing text, images and more in the original feeds.

== Other add-Ons ==

* **[Excerpts & Thumbnails](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/extension/excerpts-thumbnails/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_et_link&utm_content=et_link)**
* **[Categories](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/extension/categories/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_cat_link&utm_content=cat_link)**

The above two add-ons enable you to enhance the typical feeds list that you can create with our shortcode or block templates. They also form part of our [Simple Feeds Bundle](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/extension/simple-feeds-bundle/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_afb_link&utm_content=afb_link).

*DISPLAYING THE FEED ITEMS*

Use the WP RSS Aggregator block or shortcode on any page or post to display the imported items.

Shortcode: `[wp-rss-aggregator]`

Each block or shortcode can use any template and it can also have its own [parameters](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/54-displaying-imported-items-shortcode), such as selecting which sources to display items from, the maximum number of items to display, whether to use pagination, which page to show, and more.

Shortcode example with parameters: `[wp-rss-aggregator source="123" limit="5"]`

It is advisable to use the 'HTML' view of the editor when inserting shortcodes with parameters.

*USAGE WITHIN THEME FILES*

Here are two examples of a function call from within a theme's files:
`
<?php
wprss_display_feed_items( $args = array(
	'limit' => '8',
	'source' => '5,9'
	));
?>
`

OR

`<?php do_shortcode('[wp-rss-aggregator]'); ?>`


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What feed sources can I import items from? =

Any source with a valid RSS or XML feed can have its feed items imported by WP RSS Aggregator. Most sites provide RSS feeds right out the box as shown [here](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/55-how-to-find-an-rss-feed). If you can't find an RSS feed, you may try to create one using [our free service](http://createfeed.wprssaggregator.com/).

- - -

= How do I display the imported feed items? =

Use the template of your choice to display imported items anywhere across your site. To show the items, you can use either one (or a combination) of the options below.

* Option 1: Use our [shortcode](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/54-displaying-imported-items-shortcode) in your posts and pages: `[wp-rss-aggregator]`
* Option 2: Use our [block](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/454-displaying-imported-items-block-gutenberg) in the Gutenberg editor (WP 5.0 and later)
* Option 3: Call the function directly within a theme: `<?php wprss_display_feed_items(); ?>`

- - -

= Is there a limit on the number of feed sources I can set up? =

No, there is no limit for the number of feed sources to import items from. Having many (50+) feed sources should not present any problems in itself. However, pulling in posts from many sites is bound to put your server under some stress, so you might want to consider using a hosting solution that goes beyond your typical shared host and [staggering the feed imports](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/200-scheduling-fetching-of-feeds-imports-for-better-performance).

Check out our dedicated page on [WordPress hosting](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/recommended-web-hosts/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_q-and-a_hosts&utm_content=q-and-a_hosts) recommendations (includes some affiliate links).

- - -

= Does WP RSS Aggregator work using JSON as the source? =

No, our plugin does not currently import from JSON, it only imports from RSS and Atom structured XML.

- - -

= Why do I get "No feed items found" when I insert the shortcode on a page or post? =

1. Try adding a few more feed sources and make sure they are valid by using the RSS Feed Validator.

2. Make sure that feed items have been imported by visiting the Feed Items page.

3. Try out the solutions listed in our [Feed Items Not Importing](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/category/80-feed-items-or-posts-not-importing) knowledge base section.

4. It's important to make sure your WordPress cron system is working well. If not, the feeds cannot be imported. If in doubt, you can install the WP Crontrol plugin to check for [bad cron](https://docs.wprssaggregator.com/cron-intervals/#bad-cron), or go to RSS Aggregator > Debugging and hit the red button to re-import all feed items.

If the problems persist, please [contact our support team](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-rss-aggregator). If you're using a premium add-on, please use the [premium support channel](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/contact/).

- - -

= Can I store imported feed items as posts? =

Yes, you can do that using the [Feed to Post](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/extensions/feed-to-post) premium add-on. You will not only be able to store items as posts, but as any post type. You can also set the author, set tags and categories, import images into the gallery or set featured images, and much more. These can then be displayed in your theme's blog page, via a page builder, etc.

- - -

= Some RSS feeds only give a short excerpt when using the add-ons. Any way around that? =

Yes, along with the [Feed to Post](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/extensions/feed-to-post) add-on we have another add-on called [Full Text RSS Feeds](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/extension/full-text-rss-feeds/) that can get the full content of most feeds that only supply a short excerpt. The Full Text RSS Feeds add-on requires Feed to Post and a valid license key to function.

- - -

= I'm not sure which premium add-ons are right for me. Can you help me out? =

Sure! We built an [add-on finder (guide)](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/add-on-finder/) that will help determine what you need.

If you need any further help you can [contact our support team](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/contact/).
