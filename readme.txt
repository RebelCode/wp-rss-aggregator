== Bloggers & Content Marketers ==

Increase your WordPress site's credibility and popularity by importing full or partial Posts into your site with our premium add-ons.

* Beginner Bloggers and Copywriters - Find and display fresh, new content to **engage and grow your audience**.
* Site Owners & Content Marketers - Curate content to **keep your avid readers on your site for longer**.

== SEO Benefits from RSS Feeds ==

Importing RSS feeds alone won't improve your site's SEO, however, if you curate content (articles, tutorials, videos, listings, etc) and bring in quality traffic, the benefits begin to appear:

* Generate lots of new backlinks to your site.
* Enhance your online presence and gain more trust.
* And therefore, you can help boost your SEO!

*Quick sidetone: Don't steal other people's work; give credit where it's due.*

== Who is this useful for? ==

Importing and displaying RSS feeds is helpful for many types of sites:

* Curate news, videos and more from the top sources in your niche.
* Add related posts from other sites to your site.
* Curate job, real estate or other listings for your market or niche.
* Show Youtube videos on your site to engage more visitors.
* Aggregate podcast episodes related to your hobby or profession.
* Writers, list your articles from across the web on your main site.
* And much more.

For example, [WP News Desk](http://wpnewsdesk.com/) curates WordPress news, tutorials and more from over 100 trusted sources. [Travel Blogger Community](http://travelbloggercommunity.com/) does something similar to share blog posts from well-known travellers. [Crypto Headlines](https://cryptoheadlines.com/youtube-videos/) shares Youtube videos from popular Youtubers. **What will you do with WP RSS Aggregator?**

*DISPLAYING THE FEED ITEMS*

You can easily select the source for your feeds and also insert a limit via [shortcode parameters](http://docs.wprssaggregator.com/shortcodes/#core-parameters) as shown below. To get your feed source ID simply hover over the required feed source in the feed source listing page. It will appear beneath the name.

`[wp-rss-aggregator source="ID" limit="num"]`

An example of a shortcode parameter in use could be:

`[wp_rss_aggregator link_before='li class="feed-link"' link_after='/li']`

It is advisable to use the 'HTML' view of the editor when inserting shortcodes with parameters.

*USAGE WITHIN THEME FILES*

Here are two examples of a function call from within the theme's files:
`
<?php
wprss_display_feed_items( $args = array(
	'links_before' => '<ul>',
	'links_after' => '</ul>',
	'link_before' => '<li>',
	'link_after' => '</li>',
	'limit' => '8',
	'source' => '5,9'
	));
?>
`

OR

`<?php do_shortcode('[wp-rss-aggregator]'); ?>`


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I display the imported feed items? =

You can either use the shortcode in your posts and pages: `[wp-rss-aggregator]`

Or you can call the function directly within your theme: `<?php wprss_display_feed_items(); ?>`

- - -

= Is there a limit on the number of feed sources I can use? =

No, there is no limit for the number of feed sources. Having many (50+) feed sources should not present any problems in itself. However, pulling in posts from many sites is bound to put your server under some stress, so you might want to consider using a hosting solution that goes beyond your typical shared host.

Check out our dedicated page on [WordPress hosting](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/recommended-web-hosts/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_q-and-a_hosts&utm_content=q-and-a_hosts) recommendations.

- - -

= Does WP RSS Aggregator work using JSON as the source? =

No, our plugin does not currently import from JSON, it only imports from RSS and Atom structured XML.

- - -

= Why do I get "No feed items found" when I insert the shortcode on a page or post? =

1. Try adding a few more feed sources and make sure they are valid by using the RSS Feed Validator.

2. Try out the solutions listed on our [Feed Items Not Importing](http://docs.wprssaggregator.com/feed-items-not-importing/) documentation page.

3. It's important to make sure your WordPress cron system is working well. If not, the feeds cannot be imported. If in doubt, you can install the WP Crontrol plugin to check for [bad cron](https://docs.wprssaggregator.com/cron-intervals/#bad-cron), or go to RSS Aggregator > Debugging and hit the red button to re-import all feed items.

If the problems persist, please [contact our support team](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-rss-aggregator). If you're using a premium add-on, please use the [premium support channel](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/contact/).

- - -

= Can I store imported feed items as posts? =

Yes! You can do that with the [Feed to Post](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/extensions/feed-to-post) premium add-on. You will not only be able to store items as posts, but also as any other custom post type. You can also set the author, set tags and categories, import images into the gallery or set featured images, and much more.

- - -

= Some RSS feeds only give a short excerpt. Any way around that? =

Yes, along with the [Feed to Post](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/extensions/feed-to-post) add-on we have another add-on called [Full Text RSS Feeds](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/extension/full-text-rss-feeds/) that can get the full content of most feeds that only supply a short excerpt. The Full Text RSS Feeds add-on requires Feed to Post and a valid license key to function.

- - -

= I'm not sure which premium add-ons are right for me. Can you help me out? =

Sure! We wrote a [post](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/add-ons-purchase/) just for you. Read about which add-ons you should buy as we explain the different types of usage so you'll know what to expect when purchasing.
